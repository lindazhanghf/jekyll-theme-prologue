For the project, I am using human-pet interaction as a guideline to design the gesture interface. Since most users are already familiar with gesture interaction with their pets, dogs in particular. In addition, there are well-defined guidelines of training dogs which can serve as references to design the gestures.

My prototype is a VR game in which players controls a third-person character using gestures that are used to interact with pets.
