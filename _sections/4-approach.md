In order to create an effective VR interface with embodied gesture-based interactions, I decided to design a gesture interface based on human-animal interactions. Human-animal relationships are wide-spread and - as we do not share a single language - they often include gestures as part of our communication. Because these gesture references are already in place, it is more natural for the players to do these gestures and easier to memorize them. In this sense, the gestures are more effective and ready to be adapted to VR.


### Human-animal Interaction
Humans have always been interacting with animals, from animal husbandry to keeping them as animal companions.

Through analyzing dog training procedures and video documentary on eagle hunters, such as [***The Eagle Huntress***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfi5JS6HTH0), lots of overlaps in tool usage and training were identified. Both dog training and eagle hunting use a combination of voice and body gesture. The process of raising and bonding with the animal is essential to effective communication with the animal. The design phase explore the development of basic interactions based on human-animal gestures.
