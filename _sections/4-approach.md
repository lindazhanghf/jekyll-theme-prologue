For the project, I am using human-pet interaction as a guideline to design the gesture interface. Since most users are already familiar with gesture interaction with their pets, dogs in particular. In addition, there are well-defined guidelines of training dogs which can serve as references to design the gestures.

My project is a **VR game with gesture control as its core game mechanism**. The player can interact with the virtual environment through the help of a virtual companion. Using gestures to communicate and command actions, the player will control the companion to do certain tasks.
