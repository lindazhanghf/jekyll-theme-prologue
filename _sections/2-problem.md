Virtual Reality (VR) is a platform that quickly became popular in the past few years, with hundreds of VR games, VR experiences, 360Â° videos releasing each year. However, the modes of interaction does not catch up. The lack of an effective, standardized interface is one of the problems of this platform.

Therefore, I am proposing a VR Gesture Interface based upon **Shneiderman's HCI framework** on user interface design.
