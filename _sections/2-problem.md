There currently is not a standard unified interface in Virtual Reality (VR), and even though interfaces start to allow gesture-based interaction many user interfaces are directly borrowed from 2D surface interactions. Too few experiences fully leverage the embodiment in VR. To address those issues and to explore a new design space, this project proposes an alternative gesture control scheme based on human-animal interaction. A interactive prototype is presented where the player use gestures to command an animal companion to finish tasks.

The song selection menu in Beat Saber, one of the most popular VR games, is based on user interface design for 2D surface interactions


VR provides the sense of embodiment by mapping the player's movement to the avatar in virtual space. However, most experiences do not utilize this feature, and the player's embodied virtual body is not being used. Furthermore, the player manipulates the VR environment by pressing buttons on the controllers, which could potentially break immersion.

Most VR controllers' button mapping is similar to traditional game controllers. HTC Vive Controllers being the exeption. However, it does requires users to learn the mapping.


Since VR interaction is particularly powerful when it uses embodiment, holding on to traditional game controllers could potentially break the immersion.
