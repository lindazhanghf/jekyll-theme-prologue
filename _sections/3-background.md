### Interaction Design Framework

Shneiderman defined <b>three principles of direct manipulation for designing a controllable user interface</b> <sub>[shneiderman1997direct]</sub>. His notion of direct manipulation was to differentiate from the traditional command-line interface at the time. It still provides valuable insights on how to design for a predictable and controllable user interface:
1. Continuous representation of the objects and actions of interest.
2. Physical actions or presses of labeled buttons instead of complex syntax.
3. Rapid incremental reversible operations whose effect on the object of interest is immediately visible.

### Gesture Interface
Most related work in gesture-based interaction design is conducted on 2D surfaces like computers and tablets. Devices used to track gestures ranges from touchscreens, depth sensors, and cameras with computer vision, etc. However, a few works attempt to apply gesture controls to VR.


Lee et al. provided a set of hand gestures to control avatars in their Virtual Office Environment System (VOES). Most of the gestures match the established mental models, for examples, the "Wave Hand" gesture is waving hand and the "Stop" gesture is a fist. They provided a good pipeline for how to process gesture data and how to break down the different data and use different classifiers <sub>[lee1998control]</sub>.

***The Unspoken*** is a VR action game in which players duel with other magicians by casting spells using gestures. The gesture interactions take advantage of embodiment in VR, which makes the game much more compelling.

***Falcon Age*** provides great examples of communicating and interacting with an animal companion--a falcon. As you play and direct your virtual falcon, the interactions involves various gestures commands such as **Whistle to call it over** and **point to direct its action**. Although this game presented multiple ways to interact with the falcon, only a few are incorporated into the actual gameplay.
