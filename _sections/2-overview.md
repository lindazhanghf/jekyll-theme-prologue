Virtual Reality (VR) is a platform that quickly became popular in the past few years, with hundreds of VR games, VR experiences, 360Â° videos releasing each year. However, the modes of interaction does not catch up. The lack of an effective, standardized interface is one of the problems of this platform.

Therefore, I am proposing a VR Gesture Interface based upon Shneiderman's HCI framework on user interface design.

My project is a <strong>VR game with gesture control as its core game mechanism</strong>. The player can interact with the virtual environment through the help of a virtual companion. Using gestures to communicate and command actions, the player will control the companion to do certain tasks.
